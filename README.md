# php-ini-url-shortener üîó

Another URL shortener written in PHP which uses an INI file as a URL storage method.

## Getting setup

1. [Download](https://github.com/robsd/php-ini-url-shortener/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract this repo.
3. Edit the **urls.ini** file with the URLs you wish to shorten in the format `example = "https://example.com"` (one per line) where **example** is the end part e g. **yourdomain.com/example** and **https://example.com** is the link you wish to shorten.
4. Upload everything to your PHP-enabled web server.

## Need a hint?

I have created 2 example shortened URLs in **urls.ini** based on the above setup guide.
